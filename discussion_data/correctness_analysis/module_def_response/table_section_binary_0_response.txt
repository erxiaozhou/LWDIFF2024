In natural language, the binary definition of the table section in WebAssembly consists of two parts: the table section itself and the table. The table section, identified by the id 4, decodes into a vector of tables that represent the tables component of a module. Each table in the vector is defined by its table type.

In JSON format, the definitions are as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "tablesec": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:04:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the table section, which is fixed at 0x04."
            },
            {
                "name": "tables",
                "type": "<Vec:table>",
                "description": "A vector of tables that represent the tables component of a module."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "table": [
            {
                "name": "type",
                "type": "tabletype",
                "description": "The type of the table."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation, the `tablesec` definition represents the table section, which has a fixed section id of 0x04 and a vector of tables. The `table` definition represents each table in the vector, which is defined by its table type.
