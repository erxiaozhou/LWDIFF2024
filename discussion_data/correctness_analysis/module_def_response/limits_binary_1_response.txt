In natural language, the binary definition of limits in WebAssembly is represented by two variants. The first variant is represented by a flag of 0x00 followed by a u32 value 'n', which denotes the minimum limit. In this case, there is no maximum limit. The second variant is represented by a flag of 0x01 followed by two u32 values 'n' and 'm', which denote the minimum and maximum limits respectively.

In JSON format, the definition of limits can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "limits": [
            {
                "name": "limits_variant",
                "type": "<Union:limits_without_max:limits_with_max>",
                "description": "The limits can be one of two variants. The first variant 'limits_without_max' represents a limit with only a minimum value. The second variant 'limits_with_max' represents a limit with both minimum and maximum values."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "limits_without_max": [
            {
                "name": "flag",
                "type": "<Fix:00:hex>",
                "description": "A flag indicating that there is no maximum limit. The flag is fixed at 0x00."
            },
            {
                "name": "min",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "The minimum limit."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "limits_with_max": [
            {
                "name": "flag",
                "type": "<Fix:01:hex>",
                "description": "A flag indicating that there is a maximum limit. The flag is fixed at 0x01."
            },
            {
                "name": "min",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "The minimum limit."
            },
            {
                "name": "max",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "The maximum limit."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation, each key represents a part of the limits definition. The 'limits' key has a list of components as its value. Each component in the list has a 'name', 'type', and 'description'. The 'name' is the name of the component, the 'type' specifies the type of the component, and the 'description' provides a detailed description of the component. The 'type' of the 'limits_variant' component is a union of two definitions, 'limits_without_max' and 'limits_with_max', representing the two variants of the limits definition. The 'limits_without_max' and 'limits_with_max' definitions are represented separately, detailing their structure and components.
