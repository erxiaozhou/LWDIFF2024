In natural language, the start section in WebAssembly binary format is defined by two components: the start section and the start function. The start section, identified by the id 8, decodes into an optional start function that represents the start component of a module. The start function is represented by a function index, which is then used to reference the function in the module.

In JSON format, the definition of the start section and start function can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "start_section": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:8:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the start section, which is fixed at 0x08."
            },
            {
                "name": "start_function",
                "type": "<Optional:start>",
                "description": "An optional start function that represents the start component of a module."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "start": [
            {
                "name": "funcidx",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "A function index that is used to reference the function in the module."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation, the "start_section" key represents the start section definition, and the "start" key represents the start function definition. Each component of the definitions is represented as an object in the list, with "name" representing the name of the component, "type" representing the type of the component, and "description" providing a detailed description of the component.
