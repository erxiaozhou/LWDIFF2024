In natural language, the data section in WebAssembly binary format is identified by the id 11 and decodes into a vector of data segments. Each data segment can be one of three variants, each variant is identified by an initial integer (0, 1, or 2) which can be interpreted as a bitfield. 

The first variant (0:u32) represents an active data segment with a memory index of 0 and an offset defined by an expression. The second variant (1:u32) represents a passive data segment. The third variant (2:u32) represents an active data segment with a memory index and an offset defined by an expression. The memory index and offset are used to specify where the data segment should be loaded in memory.

In JSON format, the definition of the data section and data segment would look like this:

```json

Please note that in the current version of WebAssembly, at most one memory may be defined or imported in a single module, so all valid active data segments have a memory value of 0.
