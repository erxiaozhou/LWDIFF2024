In natural language, the global section in WebAssembly binary format is identified by the section id 6. It decodes into a vector of globals that represent the globals component of a module. Each global is defined by a globaltype and an expression. The globaltype defines the type and mutability of the global variable, while the expression provides the initial value of the global variable.

In JSON format, the definition of the global section and global can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "globalsec": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:6:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the global section, which is fixed at 0x06."
            },
            {
                "name": "globals",
                "type": "<Vec:global>",
                "description": "A vector of global variables that represent the globals component of a module."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "global": [
            {
                "name": "gt",
                "type": "globaltype",
                "description": "The type and mutability of the global variable."
            },
            {
                "name": "e",
                "type": "expr",
                "description": "The initial value of the global variable."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In the above JSON, the `globalsec` definition represents the global section, which consists of a section id and a vector of globals. The `global` definition represents each global variable, which consists of a globaltype and an expression.
