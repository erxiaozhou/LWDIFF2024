In natural language, the binary definition of **f64** in WebAssembly represents a 64-bit floating-point value. This value is encoded directly by its IEEE 754-2019 (Section 3.4) bit pattern in little endian byte order. The definition consists of a sequence of bytes, with the length of the sequence being 64/8 = 8 bytes.

In JSON format, the definition of **f64** can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "f64": [
            {
                "name": "byte_sequence",
                "type": "<Array:byte:8>",
                "description": "A sequence of 8 bytes representing the IEEE 754-2019 (Section 3.4) bit pattern of the 64-bit floating-point value in little endian byte order."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation, the key "f64" represents the name of the definition. The value is a list of the definition's components. In this case, there is only one component named "byte_sequence". The type of this component is an array of 8 bytes, represented as "<Array:byte:8>". The description provides a detailed explanation of the component.
