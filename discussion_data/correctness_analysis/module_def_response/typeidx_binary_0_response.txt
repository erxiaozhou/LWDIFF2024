In WebAssembly, the **typeidx** is a binary index that is used to reference a type in the type section of a WebAssembly module. It is represented as a variable-length integer, also known as a **u32**. The **typeidx** is used to specify the type of a function, for example, when defining the function's signature.

In JSON format, the binary definition of **typeidx** can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "typeidx": [
            {
                "name": "index",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "A variable-length integer that references a type in the type section of a WebAssembly module."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

This JSON representation follows the guidelines provided. The key "typeidx" represents the name of the definition, and the value is a list of the definition's components. In this case, there is only one component, "index", which is of type "u32" and is described as a variable-length integer that references a type in the type section of a WebAssembly module.
