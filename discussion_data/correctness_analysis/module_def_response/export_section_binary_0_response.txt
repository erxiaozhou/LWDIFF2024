In natural language, the export section in WebAssembly binary format is identified by the ID 7. It decodes into a vector of exports that represent the exports component of a module. Each export is defined by a name and an export description. The export description can be one of four types: a function index, a table index, a memory index, or a global index. Each of these types is identified by a unique constant value (0x00 for function, 0x01 for table, 0x02 for memory, and 0x03 for global), followed by the respective index.

In JSON format, the definition of the export section and its components would be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "exportsec": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:07:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the export section, which is fixed at 0x07."
            },
            {
                "name": "exports",
                "type": "<Vec:export>",
                "description": "A vector of exports that represent the exports component of a module."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "export": [
            {
                "name": "name",
                "type": "utf8str",
                "description": "The name of the export."
            },
            {
                "name": "desc",
                "type": "exportdesc",
                "description": "The description of the export, which can be a function index, a table index, a memory index, or a global index."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "exportdesc": [
            {
                "name": "func",
                "type": "<Fix:00:hex>",
                "description": "A constant value identifying a function index."
            },
            {
                "name": "table",
                "type": "<Fix:01:hex>",
                "description": "A constant value identifying a table index."
            },
            {
                "name": "mem",
                "type": "<Fix:02:hex>",
                "description": "A constant value identifying a memory index."
            },
            {
                "name": "global",
                "type": "<Fix:03:hex>",
                "description": "A constant value identifying a global index."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Please note that the `exportdesc` type is a union of four different types, each identified by a unique constant value.
