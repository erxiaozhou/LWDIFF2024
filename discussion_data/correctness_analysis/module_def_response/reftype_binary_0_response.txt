In natural language, the binary definition of **reftype** in WebAssembly is a single byte that represents a reference type. It can have two possible values: `0x70` which represents a `funcref` and `0x6F` which represents an `externref`.

In JSON format, the definition of **reftype** can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "reftype": [
            {
                "name": "funcref",
                "type": "<Fix:70:hex>",
                "description": "A single byte that represents a function reference."
            },
            {
                "name": "externref",
                "type": "<Fix:6F:hex>",
                "description": "A single byte that represents an external reference."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation, each key in the JSON represents the name of a definition. The value is a list of the definition's components. Each component in the list includes the following fields: `name`, `type`, and `description`. The `name` specifies the name of the component. The `type` specifies the type of the component. If a type has multiple variants, it is explicitly defined as a union using `<Union:...>`. The `description` provides a detailed description of the component.
