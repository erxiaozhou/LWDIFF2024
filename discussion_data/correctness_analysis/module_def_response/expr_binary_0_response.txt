In natural language, the binary definition of **expr** in WebAssembly represents an expression. It is composed of a sequence of instructions, each represented by **instr**, and is terminated by an explicit end opcode, represented by the hexadecimal value `0x0B`. 

In JSON format, the definition of **expr** can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "expr": [
            {
                "name": "instructions",
                "type": "<Vec:instr>",
                "description": "A sequence of instructions, each represented by 'instr'."
            },
            {
                "name": "end",
                "type": "<Fix:0B:hex>",
                "description": "An explicit end opcode, represented by the hexadecimal value '0x0B', that terminates the sequence of instructions."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation:

- The key `expr` represents the name of the definition.
- The value is a list of the definition's components.
- The first component, `instructions`, is a vector of instructions, each represented by `instr`.
- The second component, `end`, is an explicit end opcode, represented by the hexadecimal value `0x0B`, that terminates the sequence of instructions.
