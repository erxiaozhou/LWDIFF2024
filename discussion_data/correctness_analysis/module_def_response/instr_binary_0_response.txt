In natural language, the binary definition of `instr` in the context of reference instructions in WebAssembly can be described as follows:

1. `ref.null t`: This instruction is represented by the byte code `0xD0` followed by a `reftype` `t`. It creates a null reference of type `t`.
2. `ref.is_null`: This instruction is represented by the byte code `0xD1`. It checks if a reference is null.
3. `ref.func x`: This instruction is represented by the byte code `0xD2` followed by a `funcidx` `x`. It creates a function reference for the function `x`.

The JSON representation of the binary definition of `instr` is as follows:
