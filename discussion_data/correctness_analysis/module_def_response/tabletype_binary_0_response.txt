In natural language, the binary definition of **tabletype** in WebAssembly is a combination of two components: `et` and `lim`. The `et` component represents the element reference type, which is a `reftype`. The `lim` component represents the limits of the table, which is a `limits` type. The `tabletype` is defined as the combination of `lim` and `et`.

In JSON format, the definition of **tabletype** is represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "tabletype": [
            {
                "name": "et",
                "type": "reftype",
                "description": "The element reference type of the table."
            },
            {
                "name": "lim",
                "type": "limits",
                "description": "The limits of the table."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

This JSON representation follows the guidelines provided. Each key in the JSON represents the name of the definition, in this case, `tabletype`. The value is a list of the definition's components, `et` and `lim`. Each component in the list includes the fields `name`, `type`, and `description`, providing a detailed description of each component.
