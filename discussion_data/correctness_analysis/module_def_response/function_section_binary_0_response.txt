In natural language, the function section in WebAssembly binary format is identified by the section id 3. It decodes into a vector of type indices that represent the type fields of the functions in the funcs component of a module. The locals and body fields of the respective functions are encoded separately in the code section.

In JSON format, the function section is represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "function_section": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:3:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the function section, which is fixed at 0x03."
            },
            {
                "name": "section_content",
                "type": "<Vec:typeidx>",
                "description": "A vector of type indices that represent the type fields of the functions in the funcs component of a module."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In this JSON representation, the `function_section` is an array of two components. The first component is the `section_id` which is a fixed hexadecimal value of 3. The second component is `section_content` which is a vector of type indices (`typeidx`). These type indices represent the type fields of the functions in the funcs component of a module.
