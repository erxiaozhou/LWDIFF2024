In natural language, a custom section in WebAssembly binary format is defined by two components: the section itself and the custom data it contains. The custom section, denoted as `customsec`, is a section with the id 0 (`section_0(custom)`). The custom data, denoted as `custom`, consists of a name and a sequence of bytes. The name is a UTF-8 string that further identifies the custom section, and the sequence of bytes is an uninterpreted sequence for custom use. If an implementation interprets the data of a custom section, then errors in that data, or the placement of the section, must not invalidate the module.

In JSON format, the definition of a custom section is represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "customsec": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:0:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the custom section, which is fixed at 0."
            },
            {
                "name": "custom",
                "type": "custom",
                "description": "The custom data contained in the section."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "custom": [
            {
                "name": "name",
                "type": "utf8str",
                "description": "A UTF-8 string that further identifies the custom section."
            },
            {
                "name": "bytes",
                "type": "<Vec:byte>",
                "description": "An uninterpreted sequence of bytes for custom use."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
