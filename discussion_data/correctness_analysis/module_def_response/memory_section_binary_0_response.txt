In natural language, the memory section in WebAssembly binary format is identified by the ID 5. It decodes into a vector of memories that represent the memory component of a module. Each memory is defined by a memory type.

In JSON format, the memory section and memory are defined as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "memory_section": [
            {
                "name": "section_id",
                "type": "<Fix:5:hex>",
                "description": "The ID of the memory section, which is fixed at 0x05."
            },
            {
                "name": "memories",
                "type": "<Vec:memory>",
                "description": "A vector of memories that represent the memory component of a module."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "memory": [
            {
                "name": "memory_type",
                "type": "memtype",
                "description": "The type of the memory."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

In the memory section, the `section_id` is a fixed hexadecimal value of 5. The `memories` is a vector of memory elements. Each memory element is defined by a `memory_type`, which is of type `memtype`.
