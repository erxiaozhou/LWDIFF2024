In natural language, the binary definition of **memidx** is not explicitly provided in the given background information. However, we can infer from the context that **memidx** is likely a memory index, used to reference a specific memory instance in the WebAssembly module. It is typically represented as a `u32` (unsigned 32-bit integer) in the binary encoding.

The binary encoding of memory instructions in WebAssembly includes a variety of load and store operations, each identified by a unique opcode (e.g., `0x28` for `i32.load`, `0x29` for `i64.load`, etc.). These instructions are followed by a `memarg` immediate, which is a structure containing an alignment hint (`a:u32`) and an offset (`o:u32`).

Please note that the actual definition of **memidx** might vary depending on the context and the specific version of the WebAssembly specification.

In JSON format, the inferred definition of **memidx** and the provided definition of `memarg` could be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "memidx": [
            {
                "name": "memidx",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "A memory index, used to reference a specific memory instance in the WebAssembly module."
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "memarg": [
            {
                "name": "align",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "An alignment hint for the memory operation."
            },
            {
                "name": "offset",
                "type": "u32",
                "description": "An offset for the memory operation."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Please note that this JSON representation is based on the inferred definition of **memidx** and the provided definition of `memarg` in the background information. The actual definitions might vary depending on the context and the specific version of the WebAssembly specification.
