In natural language, the import section in WebAssembly binary format is identified by the id 2. It decodes into a vector of imports that represent the imports component of a module. Each import is defined by a module name, a name, and an import description. The import description can be one of four types: a function, a table, a memory, or a global, each identified by a specific byte (0x00 for function, 0x01 for table, 0x02 for memory, and 0x03 for global) followed by a type index or type.

In JSON format, the definition of the import section and its components can be represented as follows:

```json

        "importsec": [

                "name": "section_id",
