In natural language, the binary definition of **numtype** in WebAssembly is a single byte that represents a number type. There are four possible values for this byte, each corresponding to a different number type. The byte `0x7F` represents the `i32` type, `0x7E` represents the `i64` type, `0x7D` represents the `f32` type, and `0x7C` represents the `f64` type.

In JSON format, this definition can be represented as follows:

```json
[
    {
        "numtype": [
            {
                "name": "i32",
                "type": "<Fix:7F:hex>",
                "description": "A single byte that represents the i32 number type."
            },
            {
                "name": "i64",
                "type": "<Fix:7E:hex>",
                "description": "A single byte that represents the i64 number type."
            },
            {
                "name": "f32",
                "type": "<Fix:7D:hex>",
                "description": "A single byte that represents the f32 number type."
            },
            {
                "name": "f64",
                "type": "<Fix:7C:hex>",
                "description": "A single byte that represents the f64 number type."
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

Each entry in the list represents a different variant of the `numtype` definition. The `name` field specifies the number type, the `type` field specifies the corresponding byte value in hexadecimal format, and the `description` field provides a detailed explanation of the component.
