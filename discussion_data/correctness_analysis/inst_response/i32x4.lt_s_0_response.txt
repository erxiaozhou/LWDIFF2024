1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i32x4.lt_s', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type 'i32', 'xN' represents 'x4' which means the operation is performed on 4 lanes, and 'vrelop' represents 'lt_s' which is a relational operation (less than, signed).

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.lt_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|i32|}(lt_s(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.lt_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|i32|}(lt_s(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i32x4.lt_s` takes two operands of type v128 from the stack. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [
            {
                "v1": "op_0.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            },
            {
                "v1": "op_1.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            }
        ],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction performs a less than comparison on corresponding lanes of two v128 operands. The result is a v128, where each lane is either all bits 1 if the comparison was true, or all bits 0 otherwise.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
