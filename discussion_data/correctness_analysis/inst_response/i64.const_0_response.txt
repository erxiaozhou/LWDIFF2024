1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64.const', and the instruction format is 't.const~c'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type, and 'c' represents a constant value.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
valid instructions Instructions Numeric Instructions i64.const~c
The instruction is valid with type [] \rightarrow [i64].

\frac{
}{
  C \vdash i64.const~c : [] \rightarrow [i64]
}
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Numeric Instructions i64.const~c
Push the value i64.const~c to the stack.

No formal reduction rule is required for this instruction, since const instructions already are values.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64.const~c` does not take any operands from the stack, but it does take an immediate argument, which is a constant value of type i64.

Result:
```json
{
    "imm_0": "i64"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

The validation rule for the `i64.const~c` instruction is straightforward. The instruction is always valid, and it does not have any input or context constraints.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

The `i64.const~c` instruction does not take any parameters and returns a value of type i64.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": [],
        "result": ["i64"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

The `i64.const~c` instruction has a single behavior. It pushes the constant value `c` onto the stack. This behavior does not depend on any input or context constraints, and it does not cause a trap.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pushes the constant value c onto the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
