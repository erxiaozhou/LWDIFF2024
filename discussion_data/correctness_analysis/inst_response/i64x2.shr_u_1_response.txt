1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.shr_u', and the instruction format is 'txN.vishiftop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type 'i64', 'x' represents a vector length '2', and 'N' represents a vector type 'v'.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.shr_u
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type i32 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value i32.const~s from the stack.

Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let c be lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(vishiftop_{i64}(i^*, s^v)).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.shr_u
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type i32 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value i32.const~s from the stack.

Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let c be lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(vishiftop_{i64}(i^*, s^v)).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.shr_u` takes two operands from the stack. The first operand is of type i32 and the second operand is of type v128. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "i32",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
{
    "InputConstraint": [
        {
            "v1": "op_0.type",
            "v2": "i32",
            "relation": "eq"
        },
        {
            "v1": "op_1.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        }
    ],
    "ContextConstraint": [],
    "Valid": true
}
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["i32", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction performs an unsigned right shift operation on a 128-bit vector. The shift amount is given by the first operand. The result is pushed onto the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
