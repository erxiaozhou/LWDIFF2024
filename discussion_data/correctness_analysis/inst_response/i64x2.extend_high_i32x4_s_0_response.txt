1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.extend_high_i32x4_s', and the instruction format is 't_2xN.vcvtop_half_t_1xM_sx^?'. Therefore, the placeholder 't_2xN' in the instruction format represents a vector of two 64-bit integers, 't_1xM' represents a vector of four 32-bit integers, and 'sx^?' represents a sign extension operation.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.extend_high_i32x4_s
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

If half is low, then:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[0 : 2].

Else:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[2 : 2].

Let j^* be the result of computing vcvtop^{s}_{|i32|,|i64|}(i^*).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(j^*).

Push the value v128.const~c onto the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.extend_high_i32x4_s
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

If half is low, then:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[0 : 2].

Else:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[2 : 2].

Let j^* be the result of computing vcvtop^{s}_{|i32|,|i64|}(i^*).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(j^*).

Push the value v128.const~c onto the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.extend_high_i32x4_s` takes a value from the stack (operand). The type of the operand should be a vector of 128 bits (v128).

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [
            {
                "v1": "op_0.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            }
        ],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops a v128 value from the stack, extends the high half of the i32x4 value to i64x2 with sign extension, and pushes the result back to the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
