1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'ref.null', and the instruction format is 'ref.null~t'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a reference type.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
valid instructions Instructions Reference Instructions ref{.null}~reference_type
The instruction is valid with type [] \rightarrow [reference_type].

\frac{
}{
  C \vdash ref{.null}~reference_type : [] \rightarrow [reference_type]
}

In future versions of WebAssembly, there may be reference types for which no null reference is allowed.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Reference Instructions ref{.null}~reference_type
Push the value ref{.null}~reference_type to the stack.

No formal reduction rule is required for this instruction, since the ref{.null} instruction is already a value.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `ref.null~reference_type` does not take any operands from the stack. The immediate argument is a reference type.

Result:
```json
{
    "imm_0": "funcref"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": [],
        "result": ["funcref"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pushes a null reference of the specified type onto the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
