1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i32x4.all_true', and the instruction format is 'shape.all_true'. Therefore, the placeholder 'shape' in the instruction format represents a SIMD shape, which is 'i32x4' in this case.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.all_true
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i_1^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)

Let i be the result of computing bool(∧(i_1 ≠ 0)^*).

Push the value i32.const~i onto the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.all_true
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i_1^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)

Let i be the result of computing bool(∧(i_1 ≠ 0)^*).

Push the value i32.const~i onto the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i32x4.all_true` takes a value from the stack (operand). The type of the operand should be v128.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
{
    "InputConstraint": [
        {
            "v1": "op_0.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        }
    ],
    "ContextConstraint": [],
    "Valid": true
}
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128"],
        "result": ["i32"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops a v128 value from the stack, checks if all lanes in the i32x4 shape are non-zero, and pushes the result as an i32 value onto the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
