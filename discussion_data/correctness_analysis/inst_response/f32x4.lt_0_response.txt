1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'f32x4.lt', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type 'f32', 'xN' represents a vector of 4 elements, and 'vrelop' represents a relational operation 'lt' (less than).

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions f32x4.lt
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{f32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{f32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{f32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|f32|}(lt_f32(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions f32x4.lt
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{f32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{f32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{f32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|f32|}(lt_f32(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `f32x4.lt` takes two operands of type v128 from the stack. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

The validation rules for the `f32x4.lt` instruction are as follows:
- Two values of type v128 must be on the top of the stack.
- The instruction pops these two values from the stack and computes the result of the 'less than' operation for each corresponding pair of lanes in the vectors.
- The result is pushed back to the stack.

Result:
```json
{
    "InputConstraint": [
        {
            "v1": "op_0.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        },
        {
            "v1": "op_1.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        }
    ],
    "ContextConstraint": [],
    "Valid": true
}
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

The `f32x4.lt` instruction takes two parameters of type v128 and returns a v128.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

The `f32x4.lt` instruction performs a 'less than' comparison on each corresponding pair of lanes in the two input vectors. The result is a vector of the same size, where each lane is either all bits zero if the comparison was false, or all bits one if the comparison was true.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction performs a 'less than' comparison on each corresponding pair of lanes in the two input vectors. The result is a vector of the same size, where each lane is either all bits zero if the comparison was false, or all bits one if the comparison was true.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
