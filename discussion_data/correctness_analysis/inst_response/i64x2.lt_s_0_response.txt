1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.lt_s', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type, and 'xN' represents a vector of 'x' number of 'N' type elements. 'vrelop' represents a vector relational operation.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.lt_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{1,|i64|}(lt_s(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.lt_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{1,|i64|}(lt_s(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.lt_s` takes two values from the stack (operands). The type of the operands should be v128.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [
            {
                "v1": "op_0.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            },
            {
                "v1": "op_1.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            }
        ],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction compares each pair of corresponding i64 lanes in the two v128 operands. If the value in the first operand is less than the value in the second operand, the result is -1; otherwise, the result is 0. The results are packed into a v128 value and pushed onto the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
