1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.extmul_high_i32x4_s', and the instruction format is 't_2xN.extmul_half_t_1xM_sx'. Therefore, the placeholder 't_2xN' in the instruction format represents a vector of two 64-bit integers (i64x2), 't_1xM' represents a vector of four 32-bit integers (i32x4), and 'sx' represents signed extension.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.extmul_high_i32x4_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

If half is low, then:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[0 : N].

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2)[0 : N].

Else:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[N : N].

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2)[N : N].

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(imul_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{|i32|,|i64|}(i^*), extend^{s}_{|i32|,|i64|}(j^*)))

Push the value v128.const~c onto the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.extmul_high_i32x4_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

If half is low, then:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[0 : N].

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2)[0 : N].

Else:

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1)[N : N].

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2)[N : N].

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(imul_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{|i32|,|i64|}(i^*), extend^{s}_{|i32|,|i64|}(j^*)))

Push the value v128.const~c onto the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.extmul_high_i32x4_s` takes two operands of type v128 from the stack. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

The instruction is valid if the top two values on the stack are of type v128. The instruction does not have any immediate arguments, so there are no constraints on them.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [
            {
                "v1": "op_0.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            },
            {
                "v1": "op_1.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            }
        ],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

The instruction takes two operands of type v128 and returns a value of type v128.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

The instruction pops two v128 values from the stack, interprets them as vectors of four 32-bit integers, performs signed multiplication on corresponding pairs of integers, and pushes the high 64 bits of the 64-bit results onto the stack as a v128 value.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops two v128 values from the stack, interprets them as vectors of four 32-bit integers, performs signed multiplication on corresponding pairs of integers, and pushes the high 64 bits of the 64-bit results onto the stack as a v128 value.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
