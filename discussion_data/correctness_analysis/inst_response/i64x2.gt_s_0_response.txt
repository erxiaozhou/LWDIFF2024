1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.gt_s', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type, and 'xN' represents a vector of 'x' number of 'N' type elements. In this case, 't' is 'i64' and 'xN' is 'x2'.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.vrelop
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{1,|i64|}(vrelop_i64(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.vrelop
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{1,|i64|}(vrelop_i64(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.gt_s` takes two operands of type v128 from the stack. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [
            {
                "v1": "op_0.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            },
            {
                "v1": "op_1.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            }
        ],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops two v128 values from the stack, compares each pair of lanes in the two vectors, and pushes a v128 result to the stack. Each lane in the result is all ones if the corresponding lane in the first input is greater than the corresponding lane in the second input, and all zeros otherwise.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
