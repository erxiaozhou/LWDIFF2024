1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64.extend_i32_u', and the instruction format is 't_2.cvtop_t_1_sx^?'. Therefore, the placeholder 't_1' in the instruction format represents 'i32' and 't_2' represents 'i64'. The 'sx' represents 'u' for unsigned conversion.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
valid instructions Instructions Numeric Instructions i64.cvtop_i32_u
The instruction is valid with type [i32] â†’ [i64].
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Numeric Instructions i64.cvtop_i32_u
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type i32 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value i32.const~c_1 from the stack.

If cvtop^{u}_{i32,i64}(c_1) is defined:

Let c_2 be a possible result of computing cvtop^{u}_{i32,i64}(c_1).

Push the value i64.const~c_2 to the stack.

Else:

Trap.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64.extend_i32_u` takes a value from the stack (operand). The type of the operand should be i32.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "i32"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
{
    "InputConstraint": [],
    "ContextConstraint": [],
    "Valid": true
}
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["i32"],
        "result": ["i64"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops a value from the stack, extends it from i32 to i64, and pushes the result back to the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    },
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction traps if the conversion is not defined.",
        "WhetherTrap": true
    }
]
```
