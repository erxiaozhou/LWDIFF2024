1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i32x4.lt_u', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type, and 'xN' represents the number of lanes in the vector, and 'vrelop' represents a vector relational operation.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.lt_u
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|i32|}(lt_u(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.lt_u
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|i32|}(lt_u(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i32x4.lt_u` takes two values of value type v128 from the stack (operands). There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops two values from the stack, compares each pair of lanes in the two vectors, and pushes the result to the stack. The result is a vector of the same size, where each lane is either all ones (if the corresponding lane in the first operand is less than the corresponding lane in the second operand) or all zeros.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
