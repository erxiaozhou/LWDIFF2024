1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i32x4.gt_s', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type 'i32', 'xN' represents 'x4' which means the operation is performed on 4 lanes, and 'vrelop' represents 'gt_s' which is a relational operation (greater than).

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.gt_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|i32|}(gt_s(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i32x4.gt_s
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i32x4}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i32x4}(extend^{s}_{1,|i32|}(gt_s(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i32x4.gt_s` takes two operands from the stack, both of type v128. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [
            {
                "v1": "op_0.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            },
            {
                "v1": "op_1.type",
                "v2": "v128",
                "relation": "eq"
            }
        ],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Valid": true
    }
]
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops two v128 values from the stack, performs a 'greater than' comparison on corresponding lanes of the two values, and pushes the result back to the stack. Each lane in the result is all ones if the first operand is greater than the second, and all zeros otherwise.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
