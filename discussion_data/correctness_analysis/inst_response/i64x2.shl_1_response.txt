1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.shl', and the instruction format is 'txN.vishiftop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type 'i64', 'x' represents the number of lanes '2', and 'vishiftop' represents the operation 'shl' (shift left).

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.shl
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type i32 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value i32.const~s from the stack.

Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let c be lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(shl_{i64}(i^*, s^2)).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.shl
Assert: due to validation, a value of value type i32 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value i32.const~s from the stack.

Assert: due to validation, a value of value type v128 is on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let c be lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(shl_{i64}(i^*, s^2)).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.shl` takes two operands from the stack. The first operand is of type i32 and the second operand is of type v128. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "i32",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

Result:
```json
{
    "InputConstraint": [
        {
            "v1": "op_0.type",
            "v2": "i32",
            "relation": "eq"
        },
        {
            "v1": "op_1.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        }
    ],
    "ContextConstraint": [],
    "Valid": true
}
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["i32", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction shifts the bits of the second operand (a v128 value) to the left by the number of positions specified by the first operand (an i32 value). The result is a new v128 value.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
