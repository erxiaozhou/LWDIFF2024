1. Infer Placeholder Values:

The concrete instruction name is 'i64x2.ne', and the instruction format is 'txN.vrelop'. Therefore, the placeholder 't' in the instruction format represents a value type, and 'xN' represents a vector of 'N' elements of type 'x'. 'vrelop' represents a vector relational operation.

2. Replace Placeholders:

After replacing the placeholders in `validation_description` and `execution_description`, we get:

Validation Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.ne
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{1,|i64|}(ne_i64(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

Execution Description:
```
exec instructions Instructions Vector Instructions i64x2.ne
Assert: due to validation, two values of value type v128 are on the top of the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_2 from the stack.

Pop the value v128.const~c_1 from the stack.

Let i^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_1).

Let j^* be the sequence lanes_{i64x2}(c_2).

Let c be the result of computing lanes^{-1}_{i64x2}(extend^{s}_{1,|i64|}(ne_i64(i^*, j^*))).

Push the value v128.const~c to the stack.
```

3. Determine Operand and Immediate Argument Types:

The instruction `i64x2.ne` takes two operands of type v128 from the stack and performs a vector relational operation. There are no immediate arguments.

Result:
```json
{
    "op_0": "v128",
    "op_1": "v128"
}
```

4. Summarize Validation Rules:

The instruction is valid if the top two values on the stack are of type v128.

Result:
```json
{
    "InputConstraint": [
        {
            "v1": "op_0.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        },
        {
            "v1": "op_1.type",
            "v2": "v128",
            "relation": "eq"
        }
    ],
    "ContextConstraint": [],
    "Valid": true
}
```

5. Summarize the type of the instruction:

The instruction takes two parameters of type v128 and returns a value of type v128.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "param": ["v128", "v128"],
        "result": ["v128"]
    }
]
```

6. Describe Possible Behaviors:

The instruction pops two values from the stack, performs a vector relational operation, and pushes the result back to the stack. The operation will not trap.

Result:
```json
[
    {
        "InputConstraint": [],
        "ContextConstraint": [],
        "Description": "The instruction pops two values from the stack, performs a vector relational operation, and pushes the result back to the stack.",
        "WhetherTrap": false
    }
]
```
