        "content": "Please summarize the binary definition of **memory section** in both natural language and JSON format. Use the attached background information, which includes the binary definition syntax and other relevant details from the WebAssembly specification, to ensure accuracy and completeness.\n\n**Formatting Requirements**:  \n\nYou are tasked with identifying and describing each part of the definition in detail. The output should be provided in JSON format, following these guidelines:\n\n1. Each key in the JSON represents the name of a definition.\n2. The value is a **list** of the definition's components.  \n3. Each component in the list must include the following fields:\n   - **`name`**: Specifies the name of the component.\n   - **`type`**: Specifies the type of the component. If a type has multiple varaints, you must explicitly define it as a union using `<Union:...>`.\n   - **`description`**: Provides a detailed description of the component.\n4. **You must first point out all variantions of the definitions and include all of them in the JSON and represent the definition using <Union:Variant1:...:VariantN>**\n\n### Rules for Representing Types\n\n1. **Basic Types**: Use a single token such as `u32`, `i32`, `blocktype`, `valtype`, `utf8str`, `byte`, etc.\n2. **Constant Values**: Represent fixed values using `<Fix:<val>:<type1>>`, where `val` is the constant value and `type1` is the type. For example, a constant `0x60` of type `hex` is written as `<Fix:60:hex>`.\n3. **Complex Types**:\n   - `<Union:<type1>:<type2>:...>`: Represents a type that can be one of multiple varaints (`type1`, `type2`, etc.).\n   - `<Array:<type1>:<n>>`: Represents an array of `n` elements, all of type `type1`.\n   - `<Vec:<type1>>`: Represents a vector of elements, all of type `type1`.\n   - `<Optional:<type1>>`: Represents an optional type `type1`.\n\n### Structured and Hierarchical Descriptions\n\n1. **Hierarchical Relationships**: If a component `<type1>` is described using another type `<type2>`, and the description for `<type2>` is included in the provided information, the LLM must:\n   - First describe `<type1>` as a single component.\n   - Provide the descriptions of `<type2>` and `<type3>` in subsequent entries, explicitly detailing their structure.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n- If a type `<type1>` can be represented as either `<type2>` or `<type3>`, and these definitions have distinct formats, the output should:\n  - Include a union representation of `<type1>` that combines `<type2>` and `<type3>`.\n  - Provide detailed descriptions of `<type2>` and `<type3>` separately, immediately following the description of `<type1>`.\n\nThe JSON output must adhere to the following structure:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"<type1>\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"...\",\n                \"type\": \"<Union:<type2>:<type3>>\",\n                \"description\": \"A description explaining that <type1> can be either <type2> or <type3>.\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"<type2>\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"...\",\n                \"type\": \"...\",\n                \"description\": \"A detailed description of <type2>.\"\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    },\n    {\n        \"<type3>\": [\n            {\n                \"name\": \"...\",\n                \"type\": \"...\",\n                \"description\": \"A detailed description of <type3>.\"\n            },\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n]\n```\nPlease ensure the response is correct and complete. The response should include all variations of the definition. Ensure the response does not misuse the `list` and (misuse meaning represent a Union as a list).\n\n**Background Information**:  \nbinary modules Modules Memory Section\nThe memory section has the id 5.\nIt decodes into a vector of memories that represent the mems component of a module.\n\n\\begin{array}{llclll}\nmemory section & memsec &::=&\n  mem^\\ast:section_5(vec(mem)) &\\Rightarrow& mem^\\ast \\\\\nmemory & mem &::=&\n  mt:memtype &\\Rightarrow& \\{ type~mt \\} \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\n**Example of a Definition**:  \n#### First example:\nThe binary syntax of data count section is \n{\n    \"data_count_section\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"section_id\",\n            \"type\": \"<Fix:0C:hex>\",\n            \"description\": \"The ID of the data count section, which is fixed at 0x0C.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"section_len\",\n            \"type\": \"u32\",\n            \"description\": \"The length of the data count section in bytes.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"name\": \"n\",\n            \"type\": \"<Optional:u32>\",\n            \"description\": \"An optional u32 value representing the number of data segments in the data section. If present, it must match the length of the data segment vector; otherwise, the module is malformed.\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n    It consists of a single field n, which is a u32 value, and its value is the length of the data section.\n    \n\n\n#### Second example:\nNone"
